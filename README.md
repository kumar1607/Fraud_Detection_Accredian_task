# Fraud_Detection_Accredian_task


Description:

The goal of this project is to identify fraudulent behavior. It is a supervised binary classification problem. The Dataset consists of ten independent features and one dependent feature 'isFraud'. Data Cleaning, i.e., missing values, the transformation of the dataset, and dealing with the issues of outliers and multicollinearity has been done. The cleaning process is described after each significant step in the notebook. After doing some exploratory data analysis and data visualization, supervised machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Deep Learning models like Artificial Neural The network has been implemented by making use of TensorFlow with functional Keras API. After model implementation, the performance of each model was evaluated using different metrics. Artificial Neural Networks gave good results on both the training and test datasets.
